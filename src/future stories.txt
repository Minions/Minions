This is a list of things that I will do in a future MMF.

* string literals
* operators
* function calls (paren syntax - I might do a temporary thing with function calls using haskell's adjacency syntax, just so that I can get some interesting cases working top to bottom.)
* syntax errors
 * escaped tab at start of line
 * tab anywhere during a line
 * missing colon on block header line
 * any whitespace char but a tab at beginning of a line
 * incorrect indentation level at beginning of any statement or block
  * gratuitously indented line (not in a block, but indented anyway)
  * excessively indented lines within blocks
  * block header that is indented incorrectly.
  * other cases
 * report errors that are found.
* report multiple errors, along with partial parse. Aka, parse every statement you can, as much as you can, and report the errors for the rest.
* Trace the physical location of everything and keep that info around. Physical location is the index in the original file (eg, before handling escape sequences).
  * Need to track line, character within line (not column: indents size is view configurable), and character within file (so a tool can find it again).
  * Probably need to track both start and stop locations.
* comments
* block docstrings
